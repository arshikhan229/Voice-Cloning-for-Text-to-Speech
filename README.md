# Voice Cloning for Text-to-Speech

This repository contains a voice cloning implementation for text-to-speech (TTS). The implementation is divided into several components for better organization and maintainability.

- `README.md`: This file. Contains information about the project and instructions for setup and usage.
- `main.py`: The main script that initiates the training and inference processes.
- `setup/install_dependencies.sh`: A shell script to install necessary dependencies.
- `config/config.py`: Configuration file for training and inference parameters.
- `utils/helpers.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
- `voice_cloning/train.py`: Contains the main training logic.
- `voice_cloning/inference.py`: Contains the logic for running inference (text-to-speech).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-cloning.git
    cd voice-cloning
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bash setup/install_dependencies.sh
    ```

## Usage

### Training

1. Configure parameters in `config/config.py`.
2. Run the main script to start training:
    ```bash
    python main.py --mode train
    ```

### Inference

1. Configure parameters in `config/config.py`.
2. Run the main script to perform inference:
    ```bash
    python main.py --mode inference --text "Your text to convert to speech"
    ```

## Configuration

You can customize the parameters in `config/config.py`. The default settings are:

```python
# Example configuration settings
learning_rate = 1e-4
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 100
model_checkpoint = 'checkpoints/model.pth'

# Inference Configuration
model_path = 'checkpoints/model.pth'
